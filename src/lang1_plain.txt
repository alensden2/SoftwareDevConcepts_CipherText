Cross my heart and hope to die
I don't need another guy
To fight my battles
To overshadow me
Don't you know I'm dangerous?
Fire burning in my blood
I got this handled
I don't need rescuing
You can call me a princess all your life
'Cause you love to keep me helpless by your side
But it ain't what I want, I'ma show you
I'ma show you
How to treat me like a queen
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a yes, your majesty?
So treat me like a queen
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a yes, your majesty?
Eyes on me like I'm a prize
But you better recognise
I'm not your angel
'Cause I belong to me
You can call me a princess all your life
'Cause you love to keep me helpless by your side
But it ain't what I want, I'ma show you
I'ma show you
How to treat me like a queen
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a yes, your majesty?
So treat me like a queen
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a yes, your majesty?
You can call me a princess all your life
'Cause you love to keep me helpless by your side
But it ain't what I want, I'ma show you
(You-you-you-you)
How to treat me like a queen
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a yes, your majesty?
So treat me like a queen
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a yes, your majesty
